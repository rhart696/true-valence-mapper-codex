# True Valence Relationship Mapper (Codex Edition)

**Short name:** True Valence Mapper
**Edition owner:** GitHub Copilot/Codex agent implementation
**Status:** 🚧 In Development

---

## Overview

This is the **Codex edition** of the True Valence Relationship Mapper, exploring GitHub Copilot and Codex-driven engineering workflows.

### Edition Focus

- Engineering workflow optimization
- Code generation efficiency
- Developer productivity enhancements
- Alternative architectural approaches

### Baseline

This edition forks from the [Claude Code edition](https://github.com/rhart696/true-valence-mapper-claude) baseline and will explore different implementation strategies.

---

## Quick Start

This repository is currently being initialized. Initial implementation coming soon.

**Expected first experiment:**
- Evaluate Codex's approach to the core relationship visualization
- Compare code generation patterns with Claude edition
- Optimize for developer velocity
